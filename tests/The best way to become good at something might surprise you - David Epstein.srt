1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Many of you here have probably heard of the 10,000 hours rule.

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,580
It's the idea that to become great in anything takes 10,000 hours of focused practice,

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,900
so you'd better get started as early as possible.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,920
The poster child for this story is Tiger Woods.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,560
His father famously gave him a putter when he was seven months old.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,040
Fast forward to the age of 21, he's the greatest golfer in the world.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,840
It's a quintessential 10,000 hours story.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,420
Another is that of the three Polger sisters,

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,760
whose father decided to teach them chess in a very technical manner from a very early age.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,560
Two of his daughters went on to become grandmaster chess players.

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:41,880
I got curious.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,000
If this 10,000 hours rule is correct,

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,060
then we should see that elite athletes get a head start in so-called deliberate practice.

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,360
And in fact, when scientists study elite athletes,

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,380
they see that they spend more time in deliberate practice.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,600
Not a big surprise.

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,100
When they actually track athletes over the course of their development,

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,460
the pattern looks like this.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,220
The future elites tend to have what scientists call a sampling period,

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,340
where they try a variety of physical activities,

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,160
they gain broad general skills,

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,200
and delay specializing until later than peers who plateau at lower levels.

23
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,540
That doesn't really comport with the 10,000 hours rule, does it?

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,960
So I started to wonder about other domains that we associate with obligatory early specialization,

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,980
like music.

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,780
Turns out the pattern's often similar.

27
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,540
The exceptional musicians didn't start spending more time in deliberate practice

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,360
than the average musicians until their third instrument.

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,320
They, too, tended to have a sampling period.

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,120
Even musicians we think of as famously precocious, like Yo-Yo Ma.

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,220
So this got me interested in exploring the developmental backgrounds of people whose work I had long admired.

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,820
Duke Ellington shunned music lessons as a kid to focus on baseball and painting and drawing.

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,980
Mariam Mirzakhani wasn't interested in math as a girl, dreamed of becoming a novelist,

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,720
and went on to become the first and so far only woman to win the Fields Medal,

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,680
the most prestigious prize in the world in math.

36
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,500
Vincent van Gogh had five different careers before flaming out spectacularly,

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,860
and in his late 20s picked up a book called The Guide to the ABCs of Drawing.

38
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,620
Claude Shannon was an electrical engineer at the University of Michigan

39
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,980
who took a philosophy course just to fulfill a requirement.

40
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,580
And in it, he learned about a near-century-old system of logic

41
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,080
by which true and false statements could be coded as ones and zeros and solved, like math problems.

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,320
This led to the development of binary code, which underlies all of our digital computers today.

43
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,340
Frances Hesselbein took her first professional job at the age of 54,

44
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,560
and went on to become the CEO of the Girl Scouts.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,820
Here's an athlete I've followed.

46
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,580
He tried some tennis, some skiing, wrestling.

47
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,200
His mother was actually a tennis coach, but she declined to coach him

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,680
because he wouldn't return balls normally.

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,220
And he kept trying more sports.

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,740
Handball, volleyball, soccer, badminton, skateboarding.

51
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,560
So, who is this dabbler?

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,400
This is Roger Federer.

53
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,620
Every bit as famous as an adult as Tiger Woods,

54
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,520
and yet even tennis enthusiasts,

55
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,560
don't usually know anything about his developmental story.

56
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,320
Why is that?

57
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,240
Well, I think it's partly because the Tiger story is very dramatic,

58
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,780
but also because it seems like this tidy narrative

59
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,420
that we can extrapolate to anything that we want to be good at in our own lives.

60
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,220
But it turns out that in many ways, golf is a uniquely horrible model

61
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,800
of almost everything that humans want to learn.

62
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,440
Golf is the epitome of what the psychologist Robin Hogarth called a kind learning environment.

63
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,720
Next steps and goals are clear, rules are clear, and never change.

64
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,180
When you do something, you get feedback that is quick and accurate.

65
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,160
Chess, also a kind learning environment.

66
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,460
On the other end of the spectrum are wicked learning environments,

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,960
where next steps and goals may not be clear.

68
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,460
Rules may change.

69
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,920
You may or may not get feedback when you do something.

70
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,940
It may be delayed. It may be inaccurate.

71
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,080
Which one of these sounds like the world we're increasingly living in?

72
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,160
So, if hyperspecialization isn't always the trick in a wicked world, what is?

73
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,280
That can be difficult to talk about,

74
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,140
because sometimes it looks like meandering or zigzagging or keeping a broader view.

75
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,500
It can look like getting behind.

76
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,140
But if we look at research on technological innovation,

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,440
it shows that increasingly, the most impactful patents are authored by teams

78
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,880
that include individuals who have worked across a large number of different technology classes

79
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,920
and often merged things from different domains.

80
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,440
Someone whose work I've admired who is sort of on the forefront of this,

81
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,320
a Japanese man named Gunpei Yokoi.

82
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,380
Yokoi didn't score well in his electronics exams at school,

83
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,360
so he had to settle for a low-tier job as a machine maintenance worker

84
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,800
at a playing card company in Kyoto.

85
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,280
He combined some well-known technology from the calculator industry

86
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,720
with some well-known technology from the credit card industry

87
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,180
and made handheld games.

88
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,500
And it turned this playing card company,

89
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,660
which was founded in a wooden storefront in the 19th century,

90
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,560
into a toy and game operation.

91
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,440
You may have heard of it. It's called Nintendo.

92
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
His magnum opus was the Game Boy.

93
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,260
We probably don't make as many of those people as we could,

94
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,060
because we don't tend to incentivize anything

95
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,440
that doesn't look like a head start or specialization.

96
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,760
And naturally, I think there are as many ways to succeed as there are people.

97
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,820
But I think we tend only to incentivize and encourage the tiger path,

98
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,460
when increasingly in a wicked world,

99
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,100
we need people who travel the Roger path as well.

100
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,280
Or as the eminent physicist and mathematician and writer,

101
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,620
Freeman Dyson, put it,

102
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,280
for a healthy ecosystem, we need both birds and frogs.

103
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,400
Frogs are down in the mud seeing all the granular details.

104
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,540
The birds are soaring up above not seeing those details,

105
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,440
but integrating the knowledge of the frogs.

106
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,300
And we need both.

107
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,000
The problem, Dyson said,

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,460
is that we're telling everyone to become frogs.

109
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,760
And I think, in a wicked world,

110
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,460
that's increasingly short-sighted.

111
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,540
Education is the ultimate idea worth spreading.

112
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,500
That's why we have a channel dedicated exclusively

113
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,020
